# Notes

# Routes

If we want to create a new Route in astro we need to create a folder called as **pages**

This folder will be responsible for the new pages, which will create a route with the name of file. For example:

```html
about.astro
```
Then, the /about page will be created and you will be able to see the content of the page.


# Components

We can not create our componentes inside **pages** folder because they are responsible for routes. 

Otherwise, we need to create a components folder to handle with new components, if you are using the same code multiple times, create a **components** folder to re-use them.
